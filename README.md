# EEG Smart Glasses

Welcome to the repository for the Smart Glasses with EEG Reading and Health Feedback! These smart glasses analyze the electrical signals of the user's brain and display health feedback on the lens, enabling effortless and regular monitoring of brain conditions, thus facilitating early detection of neural diseases and strokes. By integrating the EEG system into glasses, I aim to reduce the invasiveness, time consumption, and cost associated with traditional EEG procedures.

### The Research
The foundation of this project is based on extensive research in the fields of neurology, EEG technology, and wearable devices. A in-depth literature review was conducted to understand the principles of EEG signals and how they correlate with neural health. This research helped identify the most relevant EEG biomarkers and their significance in diagnosing various neurological conditions. Our study of existing EEG devices and wearable technologies provided insights into the limitations of current solutions. We recognized the need for a non-invasive, comfortable, and user-friendly EEG monitoring system that could seamlessly integrate into daily life without compromising data accuracy.

#### Electrode Placement
To ensure optimal daily monitoring, the strategic use of only two electrodes placed on the T7 (left temporal) and T8 (right temporal) areas is preferred. This specific electrode placement is scientifically advantageous as it minimizes interference from the positive-charged eyeball artifacts, which can distort EEG readings. By focusing on these lateral temporal regions, the EEG signals can be more accurately captured, providing valuable insights into the brain's electrical activity and facilitating more precise neurological assessments.

#### Electrode Type
The best electrodes for EEG (Electroencephalography) are typically silver/silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) electrodes. These electrodes offer low impedance, stable and reliable recordings, and minimal skin irritation. They provide accurate signal acquisition and are widely used in EEG research and clinical applications due to their excellent conductivity properties and biocompatibility with the skin.

#### Best Solution
Developing smart glasses with EEG detection capabilities is an ideal approach due to the high prevalence of neural disease patients among seniors, constituting 80% of the affected population. Leveraging the fact that an impressive 92% of seniors already wear glasses, incorporating EEG technology into these smart eyewear devices offers a non-intrusive and convenient means of monitoring brain activity, facilitating early detection and personalized management of neurological conditions in this vulnerable demographic.

### Design and Modelling
A 3D modeling software named Blender was utilized to design the glasses, considering ergonomic factors and feedback from potential users. Multiple iterations of the 3D model were developed and tested to ensure optimal fit and comfort for various head shapes and sizes. An aesthetic look was considered, while still in incorporating places for wires, circuit boards and holes for electrodes to read the EEG of the user.
